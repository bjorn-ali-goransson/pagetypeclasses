# PageTypeClasses

This simple little script will generate .cs page type classes out of your legacy, DB-only page types. Drop in the base of your project and navigate to /PageTypeClasses or access the link from the EPiServer admin interface.

Forked from [Alf Nilsson](https://github.com/alfnilsson/pagetypeclasses) in 2015, who forked it from [Erik Nordin](https://github.com/eriknordin/PTB-Helpers) in 2013. The original implementation by Erik is from 2009.
